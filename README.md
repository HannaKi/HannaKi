### Hi there :coffee: I am Hanna

I study Computer Sciences in Turku University. I love to code with Python and R and things get even more exciting if I get to visualize the things I code. <!-- So here is a plot for you: -->

I have some five and a half years of experience working with quantitative data and questionnaire formulas. It often seemed that people wanted to write down what they had in their mind instead of ticking the boxes in the questionnaire formulas. But how to analyze all that text? When searching for the answer to this question I came across with NLP, Natural Language Processing. I could informally say NLP means processing spoken and written human language programmatically. 

Just how cool is that?! 

And then came along neural networks, machine learning and modeling. So these are the things I would love to do in the future. If you check out my public repositories you will find out I have not abandoned pure number crunching either.
